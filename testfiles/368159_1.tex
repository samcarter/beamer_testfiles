            ACM A.M. Turing Award (1991). For three distinct and complete achievements:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item LCF, the mechanization of Scott's Logic of Computable Functions, probably the first theoretically based yet practical tool for machine assisted proof construction.
                \item ML, the first language to include polymorphic type inference together with a type-safe exception-handling mechanism.
                \item CCS, a general theory of concurrency.
            \end{itemize}
            In addition, he formulated and strongly advanced full abstraction, the study of the relationship between operational and denotational semantics.
